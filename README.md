# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis

This is a simple data analysis challenge lab exploring flight delay patterns using Python and Pandas.  
The goal is to clean the dataset, perform basic exploratory analysis, and visualize delay trends across airlines and time periods.

**Notebook:**  
`Flight_Delay_Analysis.ipynb`

**Tools & Libraries:**  
Python · Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Jupyter Notebook

**Key Steps:**  
- Loaded and explored flight delay dataset  
- Cleaned missing or invalid data  
- Created basic visualizations using Matplotlib  
- Summarized delay patterns by airline and time of day  

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
Data Cleaning · Data Visualization · EDA · Python Programming

**How to Run:**  
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code  
2. Run all cells to view analysis and charts  

**Duration:** April 2025
